## Homework Assignment (3 minutes)

Today's homework will focus on both conceptual understanding and performance analysis of the list data structures we've discussed. There are two main tasks.

### Homework Task 1: Implement a custom linked list in Java. (1 minute)

Your first task is to implement your own version of a singly linked list in Java. This will help you understand the underlying mechanics of the LinkedList class provided by Java.

#### Code Hints:
/*
* Homework Task 1: Implement a custom linked list
  */

// Define a Node class
class Node {
int data;
Node next;

    Node(int data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}

// Define your custom linked list
class MyLinkedList {
Node head;

    // Implement methods like add, remove, and print
}

Feel free to implement additional methods like `add()`, `remove()`, and `print()` to test your linked list.

### Homework Task 2: Benchmark ArrayList and LinkedList for various operations and analyze the results. (2 minutes)

Your second task is to benchmark the performance of ArrayList and LinkedList for different operations like adding elements, removing elements, and accessing elements. You should measure the time taken for each operation and compare the results.

#### Code Hints:
/*
* Homework Task 2: Benchmark ArrayList and LinkedList
  */

ArrayList<Integer> arrayList = new ArrayList<>();
LinkedList<Integer> linkedList = new LinkedList<>();

// Record start time
long startTime = System.nanoTime();

// Perform operations on ArrayList
// ...

// Record end time and calculate elapsed time for ArrayList
long endTime = System.nanoTime();
long elapsedTimeArrayList = endTime - startTime;

// Repeat the process for LinkedList
// ...

// Compare and analyze the results

Please submit your analysis along with your code. What conclusions can you draw regarding the performance trade-offs between ArrayList and LinkedList?
