# Grading Rubric for Homework Assignment

## Homework Task 1: Implement a custom linked list in Java (Maximum Points: 40)

| Criteria       | Excellent (35-40 points)   | Good (30-34 points)   | Satisfactory (25-29 points)   | Needs Improvement (0-24 points)   |
|----------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Functionality  | Fully functional custom linked list with methods for add, remove, and print. | Mostly functional but minor issues exist. | Partially functional; major features are missing or flawed. | Not functional; the code does not compile or run. |
| Code Quality   | Code is exceptionally clean and well-organized, with proper indentation and naming conventions. | Code is mostly clean and well-organized; minor inconsistencies may exist. | Code is readable but lacks organization or has multiple issues. | Poorly written code with numerous errors. |

## Homework Task 2: Benchmark ArrayList and LinkedList (Maximum Points: 50)

| Criteria       | Excellent (45-50 points)   | Good (40-44 points)   | Satisfactory (35-39 points)   | Needs Improvement (0-34 points)   |
|----------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Benchmarking   | Comprehensive benchmarking of ArrayList and LinkedList for multiple operations (add, remove, access). Provides accurate timings. | Good benchmarking but lacks some details or has minor inaccuracies. | Benchmarks are present but either too few or have major inaccuracies. | No benchmarks or completely inaccurate benchmarks. |
| Analysis       | In-depth analysis comparing ArrayList and LinkedList, drawing well-supported conclusions. | Good analysis but lacks depth or has minor gaps in logic. | Some analysis but lacks clarity or has major errors. | No analysis or completely incorrect analysis. |

## Code Documentation and Submission (Maximum Points: 10)

| Criteria       | Excellent (9-10 points)    | Good (7-8 points)      | Satisfactory (5-6 points)      | Needs Improvement (0-4 points)    |
|----------------|----------------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Documentation  | Code is thoroughly documented with comments, making it easy to understand. | Code has some comments but lacks completeness. | Code has very few comments, making it hard to understand. | No comments or documentation. |
| Submission     | All files are submitted neatly, with clear filenames and any necessary instructions for running the code. | Most files are submitted neatly but lack some organization or clarity. | Files are submitted, but organization is poor or instructions are missing. | Incomplete submission or files are missing. |
